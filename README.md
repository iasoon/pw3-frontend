A frontend for [pw3-moz2](https://github.com/iasoon/pw3-moz2).

## Building

Requirements:
- rust nightly (https://rustup.rs/)
- wasm-pack (https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
- node.js >= 12

Then just do `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`, and you're off!

For the dev server to work, you'll need to have your `pw3-moz2` lobby server running.
